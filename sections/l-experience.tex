\vspace{\contentTopMarginAlt} % this is quite an unique box because this two-col split for Junior and Intern. While interning I was mostly working on API Gateway, later the time was split between API Gateway and maintaining and upgrading other products (analytics, alerting, circuit breaker, containerization, http client and internal utils lib). After that I got reassigned to the strike team working on new projects.
{\contentFont As a part of the core engine team, my work usually consists of maintaining and upgrading the heart of the platform which processes over 1.5 million transactions daily. My main projects are building an API Gateway system from ground up and containerizing and upgrading the CI/CD pipeline. I've enhanced analytics collection and worked on migrating from RMI to HTTP communication between services. I was also a part of a strike team which developed new microservices and adapted existing infrastructure for emerging business needs. I've had the chance to work with Cloudflare and its serverless Workers platform to cut loading time of payment pages for up to 2 seconds.}
