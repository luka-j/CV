# CV

In this repository I host my general-purpose CV (i.e. for when there are no specific requirements to tailor for). GitHub doesn't allow links in preview PDFs so in order to properly view it, you need to download the file and use some other viewer (browsers do fine). My goal is to one day rewrite it in LaTeX, but as long as it looks like a 3-day job when it could be done in half a day, that's not going to happen. No templates were hurt over the course of making this document. Icons used throughout the document are licenced to FontAwesome under the terms of CC BY 4.0.
