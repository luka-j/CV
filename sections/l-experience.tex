\vspace{\contentTopMarginAlt} % this is quite an unique box because this two-col split for Junior and Intern. While interning I was mostly working on API Gateway, later the time was split between API Gateway and maintaining and upgrading other products (analytics, alerting, circuit breaker, containerization, http client and internal utils lib). After that I got reassigned to the strike team working on new projects.
{\contentFont As a part of the core engine team, I've had the chance to upgrade and maintain a live production system which processes over 1.5 million payment transactions daily. My main projects are building and maintaining a custom API Gateway project and containerizing and upgrading the CI/CD pipelines and monitoring stack. I've also had the chance to work with Cloudflare Workers serverless platform to cut loading time of payment pages for up to 2s. More recently, I was a part of a strike team which developed new microservices for various business needs. I've also taken a significant part in developing a multi-tenant storefront app and adapted existing infrastructure to enable a successful launch on GKE, making it our first service to go live on the cloud. }%
